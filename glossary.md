## Glossary

Recall: a ratio representing the number of true positives divided by the number of true positives plus the number of false negatives.

CPU: acronym for Central Processing Unit -  portion of a computer that retrieves and executes instructions. CPUâ€™s are used in this context to execute a sequence of stored instructions (commands). An example of a notebook exploration that relies on the use of CPU can be found here. 

False positive: A false positive, also referred to as type I error in Statistics, is an error in prediction where a negative example is misclassified as a positive example. In this context, a false positive is an indication of a Lipohypertrophy mass when there is none in reality. 

False negative: A false negative, also referred to as type II error in Statistics, is an error in prediction where a positive example is misclassified as a negative one. In this context, a false negative is an indication of a no Lipohypertrophy presence when there is in reality. 

Executable: a file or program with the ability to be run by a computer.

Epochs: A number defining the number of times that the learning algorithm will pass through the entire training dataset. 

Transfer learning : a technique that allows us to leverage models that have already been trained on thousands of images from various data sources.

YOLO: short for You Only Look Once, YOLO is an object detection framework that uses convolutional neural networks to train on images and optimize detection performance in real-time. 

Ensemble Learning: The use of multiple learning algorithms to obtain improved predictive performance than any individual learning algorithm predictive performance. In this context, an ensemble approach could result from averaging the predictions from multiple models.
